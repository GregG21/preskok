/*
Closures cannot access the arguments object of the parent, 
but, because functions are first class objects, we can pass a function as a parameter. 
The closure can now access the arguments object of the function that is passesd as a parameter.
So, there is no confusion as to which arguments object we want the closure to access. 
We're basically taking advantage of its limitations
